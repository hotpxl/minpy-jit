# MinPy JIT

Bringing just-in-time compilation to MXNet.

## Development

Please adhere to [Google Python Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

With [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) installed, run
`python-format.sh` before committing to format all code.

## Installation

Currently no installation is needed even there is a `setup.py` file
present. For examples, use `sys.path` manipulation to make it easier
to hack.
